Analysis of California energy supply, demand, and emissions from publicly available CAISO data

This repo contains some data scraped from the [CAISO Today's Outlook page](http://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/default.aspx) and plotted in a different manner.  The Data Collection notebook shows how I pulled the data down and aggregated it into more usable CSV files.  The Data Presentation notebook shows how I plotted some of the data.  More analysis code will be committed as I go and the final results will be turned into an informational page.
